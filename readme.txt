Easily integrate data from your Recras instance, such as packages and contact forms, into your own website.

== Description ==
With this plugin, you can easily integrate data from your [Recras](https://recras.nl/) instance, such as packages and contact forms, into your own website.

To get started, go to the Recras → Settings page and enter your Recras domain. For example, if you log in to Recras at `https://mycompany.recras.com/` then enter `mycompany.recras.com`. That's all there is to it! You can now use widgets to retrieve data. All data is retrieved via a secured connection (HTTPS) to ensure data integrity. Other than the request parameters, no data is sent to the Recras servers.

This plugin consists of the following "widgets". To use them, you first need to set your Recras domain (see paragraph above).
* Book processes
* Contact forms
* Packages
* Products
* Voucher info

Widgets can be added to your site in three ways. Using Gutenberg blocks (recommended), using the buttons in the "classic editor" (limited functionality), or by entering the shortcode manually (discouraged).

= Date picker for contact forms =
By default, date pickers in contact forms use the browser date picker. If you want to be able to style the date picker, we recommend to enable the date picker we have included with the plugin. You can enable this on the Recras → Settings page.

**Note**: this setting only applies to standalone contact forms, not to contact forms used in the old online booking of packages integration or in book processes.

= Styling =
No custom styling is applied by default, so it will integrate with your site easily. If you want to apply custom styling, see `css/style.css` for all available classes. Be sure to include these styles in your own theme, this stylesheet is not loaded by the plugin!
For styling the date picker, we refer you to the [Pikaday repository](https://github.com/Pikaday/Pikaday). Be sure to make any changes in your own theme or using WordPress' own Customizer.

= Cache =
All data from your Recras is cached for up to 24 hours. If you make important changes, such as increasing the price of a product, you can clear the cache to reflect those changes on your site immediately.

= Google Analytics integration =
You can enable basic Google Analytics integration for the booking of packages and voucher sales by checking "Enable Google Analytics integration?" on the Recras Settings page. This will only work if there is a global `ga` JavaScript object. This should almost always be the case, but if you find out it doesn't work, please contact us!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you support Elementor, WPBakery/Visual Composer, Brizy, etc. ? =
Integrating a book process is possible through Elementor. There are many different page builders but Elementor is the most used one, so we chose to only build this widget for Elementor. Using shortcodes is still possible in all other builders, of course.

= Does the plugin support network installations? =
Yes it does. You can set different Recras domains (all settings, for that matter) for each site.

= Can the plugin be installed as "must use plugin" ? =
No. "Must use" plugins don't appear in the update notifications nor show their update status on the plugins page (direct quote from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/must-use-plugins/">WordPress documentation</a>) which is reason enough for us not to support this.
